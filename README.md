Lab 8: The importance of the ploting

Task 1) Analyze the dataset: ans.csv

Calculate the missing values (fill the tables).

Property	Value	Accuracy
- Mean of x	?	?
- Sample variance of x	?	?
- Mean of y	?	?
- Sample variance of y	?	?
- Correlation between x and y	?	?
- Linear regression line (y = a+bx)	?	?
- Coefficient of determination of the linear regression	?	?

Task 2) Analyze the dataset: ans2.tsv

Calculate the missing values (fill the tables).

Property	Value	Accuracy (up to 3 places)
- Mean of x	?	?
- Mean of y	?	?
- SD of x	?	?
- SD of y	?	?
- Corr	?	?

Homework:

Make the report in html (from jupyter) with the filled tables and scatter plots for:

- point 1, one single plot similar to the one from Wikipedia
- point 2, in this case make separte subplots for each dataset

The report should contain:

- the main report file in html (with all the plots embedded)
- the jupyter notebook.

The homework should be sent until 26.04.2020 via email to lukaskoz@mimuw.edu.pl with the email subject:

'lab8_hw_Name_Surname' without email text body and with 'lab8_hw_Name_Surname.7z' (ASCII letters only) attachment.

All emails with a different structure (the one that will not go through email filter to the proper email folder dedicated for home works) will be scored -10%

Using non-English labels, legends, descriptions, etc. will be scored -10%

Additionally, all problems with the structure of the plot e.g. the plot size, labels font size, etc. will also affect the grading. You need to follow advice included in the lectures.
